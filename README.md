My_Music_App
My_Music_App is an application that has two screens, each one of them having a well-designed purpose. The purpose of this application is to help users create their own playlist in a fun and effortless way by entering few details about each song of their playlist. Based on short feedback the app provides the next step to the user. Also, parallel arrays are used in this application to make it easy to store the input of the user, the code looks much simpler and easier to understand.

What is GitHub? 
Let us start with the word “Git” - what is it?
Git is a distributed Version Control System (VCS) that tracks changes, enables collaborations, and allows developers to work independently before integrating updates. It uses commits, branches, and merges to manage code efficiently (Tu et Al., 2022).
Now according to Tu et Al. (2022), GitHub is a platform for storing and sharing Git Repositories, offering tools for collaboration, code review (Pull Requests), automation (GitHub Actions), and project management. It also serves as a social hub for developers to
share and contribute to projects.

What is “yml” file and why do we use it?
This file is used in GitHub Actions. Then GitHub Actions is a platform that offers automation and a framework that was missing from Git. The file “yml” is used just to verify that the app runs correctly.

For the first screen “Main Screen” of this app, this part of code is all about declaring variables, arrays to store the details of the songs that will be displayed unto the second screen as well as buttons to move into the app.

In this part of the code, the second screen called “Display Screen” is bringing all the details entered by the user on the first screen here to display them. On this screen, the app also calculates the average rating of the playlist using a loop and allow
as well the user to go back to the first for any changes.
